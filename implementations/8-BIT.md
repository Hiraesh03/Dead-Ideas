## Why use this?

Why not?
You have duolingo pinging on your phone for 500 days ,why not give 8-Bit 8 minutes? 

## Why we built this?

Partly because our quick google search found out the sheer lack of free and fun programming language app,especially for the kids.You could say this is our way to bring a retro styled ,engaging,game-like learning experience that is specially tailored for kids
